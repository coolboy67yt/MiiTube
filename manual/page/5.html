    <h3>You may be wondering, What are these "secrets"?</h3>

    <p>
        You may have found something like this: [<a href="" onclick="alert('This.. is not an actual secret. Just an example :/')">secret?</a>] in random places<br>
        of the site. They're simple little easter eggs, not much more to it. However:<br>
        Some contain Mii QR codes that you can use on <a href="https://mii.nxw.pw">Mii Creator</a>.<br>
        <br>
        Try to find them all! ;]

## 📖 What is MiiTube?
**MiiTube** is a simple but growing project that organizes and archives  
YouTube videos connected to classic Nintendo systems and avatars we all grew up with:

- Miis  
- Wii  
- Wii U  
- Nintendo 3DS  
- And more to come...

The goal is to create a clean, unified place for fans, creators, and modders  
who love Nintendo’s Mii culture and the era around it.

## 1. Getting Started
This step is the most simple.

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Create a new branch** for your changes in your fork.  
   Example: `fix/manualpg3fix`
3. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/MiiTube.git```

4. Set up a small **web server** to test locally.
   Anything works. Python, Node, PHP, whatever you want.:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```
   Or, if you don't want to do this locally, you can deploy your fork with **Vercel** instead.
   
6. Now you're ready to make your changes!
